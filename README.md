# SwiftUITableView

Only Purpose of this repo is to increase understanding about the list(tableView) using SwiftUI. I have created a simple project in which I load some Landmark. This project cover following things :- 

1. How to create a list View.
2. How to change the color of section header in list View(this is not as easy as in UIKit).
3. Navigation Link and detail screen
